# yssh ðŸ‘Œ

_Note:_ _"yssh"_ stands for "Youtube Songs Separation Helper".

This project helps to automatically download songs from YouTube and generate their respective separate instrument tracks. This is achieved using the library [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) to download the audio files and [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) to automatically separate instrument tracks from the downloaded files.

## Usage ðŸ› 
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up dependencies (check the [requirements file](requirements.txt) to see the dependencies).

2. Add all the desired YouTube URLs in a file called `inputs.txt` (in the same directory as the script). Enter one URL per line, as shown below:

Example contents for `inputs.txt`:
```plain-text
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMxThvH-6Tw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ObT7LQd6ls
```

3. Run python main.py, wait for the process to complete, and enjoy the conversions. They will be placed in the /separated directory.

âš  _Quick note: the process is finished when console displays the message "`Finished all conversions of the videos from 'inputs.txt'.`"_
